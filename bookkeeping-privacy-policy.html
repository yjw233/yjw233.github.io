### Privacy Policy for 全能记账王
**Last Updated: Feb 2, 2016**

This Privacy Policy describes how we collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal and financial data when you use our personal finance and bookkeeping mobile application ("the App", "全能记账王"). This policy applies to all users of the App and specifically addresses data accessed through Apple's FinanceKit framework, as required for the App's core bookkeeping functionality.

### 1. Information We Collect
We collect only the data necessary to provide our core bookkeeping and expense tracking services. The data we access falls into two categories:

#### 1.1 Data Accessed via FinanceKit
With your **explicit, voluntary authorization**, we may access the following financial data through Apple's FinanceKit APIs:
- Transaction details: amount, date, time, transaction description, merchant name, and transaction category;
- Account information: account type (e.g., checking, savings, credit card), account nickname, and current balance (only as needed for transaction association);
- Basic financial metadata: spending categories and transaction labels assigned by financial institutions.

We **do not collect** sensitive financial credentials such as bank account numbers, credit card CVV, PIN codes, passwords, or login information for financial accounts via FinanceKit or any other means.

#### 1.2 Voluntarily Provided Data
We may collect data you manually input into the App, including custom expense categories, budget goals, notes for transactions, and user profile information (e.g., name, email, if you create an account).

### 2. How We Use Your Data
All data collected—including data accessed via FinanceKit—is used **exclusively for the App's core bookkeeping and personal finance management features**. Specific uses include:
- Automatically syncing and recording financial transactions to eliminate manual data entry;
- Categorizing income and expenses for budget tracking and financial reporting;
- Generating personalized financial insights, spending summaries, and budget alerts;
- Maintaining accurate, up-to-date personal financial records within the App.

We **will not use your financial data** for advertising, marketing, user profiling for commercial purposes, or any secondary use unrelated to the App's core bookkeeping functionality. We do not sell, rent, lease, or share your personal or financial data with third parties, including advertisers, data brokers, or external analytics services, unless required by law.

### 3. Data Storage & Security
We prioritize the security and confidentiality of your financial data:
- **Encryption**: All data accessed via FinanceKit and stored in the App is encrypted in transit (using HTTPS/TLS 1.3) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption).
- **Storage Location**: Financial data is primarily stored **locally on your device** by default. Cloud backup (e.g., iCloud) is only enabled if you explicitly opt in, and all cloud-stored data remains encrypted.
- **Data Retention**: We retain your financial data only for as long as you use the App. If you delete your account or revoke FinanceKit access, we will permanently delete all associated financial data within 30 days, except where retention is required by applicable law.
- **Access Controls**: Internal access to user data is strictly limited to authorized personnel only for technical support and app maintenance, with strict confidentiality agreements in place.

### 4. User Rights & Control
You retain full control over your data and FinanceKit authorization:
- **Authorization Management**: You can enable or revoke FinanceKit access at any time through your iOS device's Settings (Settings > [Your App] > FinanceKit). Revoking access will immediately stop the collection of new financial data via FinanceKit.
- **Data Access & Deletion**: You can view, edit, or delete manually input data and FinanceKit-synced transactions directly within the App. To request full account or data deletion, contact us at 1356244839@qq.com.
- **Opt-Outs**: You may choose not to authorize FinanceKit access and use the App with manual data entry only.

### 5. Compliance with Apple Policies & Regulations
We comply with Apple's [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/), Apple Developer Program License Agreement, and all terms governing the use of FinanceKit. We also adhere to global data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for users in California.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
